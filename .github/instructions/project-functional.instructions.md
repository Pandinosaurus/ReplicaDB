# ReplicaDB: Business Context and Functional Scope

## Business Context and Objectives

ReplicaDB solves the **enterprise data movement challenge** where organizations need to:

- **Migrate legacy data** from expensive proprietary databases to open-source alternatives
- **Synchronize data** between production systems and analytics warehouses
- **Transfer data** across different cloud platforms during migrations
- **Replicate data** for disaster recovery without complex streaming solutions
- **Load data** into data lakes from operational systems

### Why ReplicaDB Exists
The tool was created because existing solutions didn't meet specific enterprise requirements:
- **SymmetricDS**: Too complex and intrusive (requires database triggers)
- **Sqoop**: Limited to Hadoop ecosystem only
- **Commercial ETL tools**: Expensive and require custom development for each table

## Functional Scope and Boundaries

### What ReplicaDB Does
- **Bulk data transfer** between any two supported data sources
- **Schema-aware replication** preserving data types and constraints
- **Parallel processing** for large datasets (configurable job count)
- **Incremental replication** using timestamp or sequential columns
- **Bandwidth throttling** for network-constrained environments

### What ReplicaDB Does NOT Do
- **Real-time streaming** - designed for batch/scheduled operations
- **Data transformation** - focuses on faithful replication, not ETL logic
- **Schema migration** - assumes target schema exists or creates simple mappings
- **Conflict resolution** - last write wins in incremental mode
- **Data validation** - trusts source data integrity

## Primary Business Workflows

### 1. One-Time Data Migration
**Scenario**: Migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL during platform modernization
- Business analyst configures source and sink connections
- DBA reviews target schema compatibility
- ReplicaDB performs complete table replication with parallel jobs
- Data integrity validation happens at application level

### 2. Scheduled Data Synchronization
**Scenario**: Nightly load from production database to analytics warehouse
- Configuration defines incremental column (last_modified timestamp)
- Scheduler triggers ReplicaDB in incremental mode
- Only new/changed records replicated since last run
- Analytics team accesses fresh data for reporting

### 3. Cross-Platform Data Movement
**Scenario**: Moving data from on-premises MySQL to AWS S3 for archiving
- ReplicaDB converts database records to CSV/ORC format
- Handles large BLOB/CLOB fields appropriately
- Integrates with existing backup and retention policies

## Business Rules and Constraints

### Data Type Compatibility Rules
- **Preserve precision**: Numeric types maintain scale and precision across databases
- **Handle LOBs gracefully**: Large objects replicated using streaming approaches
- **Map vendor types**: Database-specific types converted to closest equivalent
- **Null handling**: Source nulls preserved in target (no null-to-default conversion)

### Transaction Consistency Rules
- **Complete mode**: All-or-nothing replication within job boundaries
- **Complete-atomic mode**: Single transaction for entire table (memory constraints apply)
- **Incremental mode**: Each batch commits independently

### Performance Constraints
- **Memory limits**: Large ResultSets use streaming to avoid OutOfMemory errors
- **Network bandwidth**: Configurable throttling prevents network saturation
- **Database impact**: Read operations designed to minimize source system impact
- **Parallel processing**: Job count limited by connection pool and target capacity

## Information and Event Flows

### Configuration Information Flow
1. **Properties file** defines source/sink connections and replication parameters
2. **ManagerFactory** analyzes JDBC URLs to select appropriate database managers
3. **ToolOptions** validates configuration and sets defaults
4. **Connection managers** establish and test database connections

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Source reading**: SQL queries or NoSQL aggregations extract data in chunks
2. **Data streaming**: ResultSet data flows through configurable fetch size buffers
3. **Type conversion**: Database-specific types converted to target format
4. **Sink writing**: Batch inserts optimize target database performance
5. **Progress tracking**: Row counts and timing metrics for monitoring

### Error Information Flow
1. **Connection errors** reported immediately with specific database details
2. **Data type errors** logged with source column and target mapping information
3. **Constraint violations** captured with affected row identifiers where possible
4. **Performance warnings** triggered when throughput falls below thresholds

## Compliance and Regulatory Context

### Data Privacy Considerations
- **No data transformation**: ReplicaDB doesn't inspect or modify sensitive data
- **Connection security**: Supports encrypted connections to all database types
- **Audit logging**: Operations logged for compliance review
- **No data persistence**: Tool doesn't store replicated data locally

### Enterprise Integration Requirements
- **Credential management**: Supports external credential stores and environment variables
- **Network security**: Works within corporate firewall and VPN constraints
- **Monitoring integration**: Sentry support for centralized error tracking
- **Deployment flexibility**: Docker/container support for modern infrastructure

## Business Trade-offs and Decisions

### Simplicity vs. Functionality
**Decision**: Prioritize ease of use over advanced ETL features
**Rationale**: Most enterprise data movement needs are straightforward replication, not complex transformation

### Performance vs. Resource Usage
**Decision**: Configurable parallelism with conservative defaults
**Rationale**: Allows optimization for specific environments while preventing resource exhaustion

### Database Support vs. Maintenance
**Decision**: Abstract SQL patterns with database-specific optimizations
**Rationale**: Broad compatibility with focused performance tuning where it matters most

### Real-time vs. Batch Processing
**Decision**: Batch-first design focused on scheduled replication
**Rationale**: Most enterprise use cases are scheduled/periodic, not streaming

## User Scenarios and Actors
